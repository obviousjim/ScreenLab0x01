1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,518
I'm a visual artist and illustrator. 	

2
00:00:06,865 --> 00:00:11,983
Yeah, I produce illustrations that is
formed from my imagination

3
00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:15,613
as well as being influenced by
sort of my environment. 

4
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:22,645
I guess my work's subject matter tends 	
to be sort of a response to my environment 

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,521
my own personal sort of reactions to
the things that happen to me. 

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,673
And it's not just about the image that
I'm creating but often it's 

7
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:35,000
experimentation with line and how
line can form the image 

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That has extended out into like my
sort of stop motion mural work 

9
00:00:43,504 --> 00:00:48,559
In the sense that I experiment with
line in story of sight-specific environments 

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and then often re-animate them and 
project them back into the spaces

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
sort of to create an installation.

12
00:00:57,368 --> 00:01:02,000
I guess, I don't know why I draw that
image like that. I think it was more

13
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:06,621
'cause I draw triangles a lot. And so
it was like, it made sense.

14
00:01:06,621 --> 00:01:11,469
But it does look like some sort of computer	
built graphic model, doesn't it?

15
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:18,000
I look at, a lot of the time when I'm
looking for ideas and research, it's um

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
All the images I'm sort of taking
inspiration from are digitally produced 

17
00:01:23,318 --> 00:01:26,352
whether that be animation or standard 
illustration. 

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,641
Whereas I think I've tried to retain
the hand drawn element to my work

19
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:36,497
because it's about my physical 
experimentation with the drawing itself. 

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,620
Um, as opposed to drawing it
on the computer. 

21
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:45,373
But then I always seem to lead back to  animating it 

22
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:51,035
and putting it through some sort of digital	process. 
So it's like adding a stage on.

23
00:01:51,393 --> 00:01:58,000
And especially when producing the animations 
it's like a drawing and then 

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I feed it back into the computer 
and then, so obviously

25
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:06,351
In this age where everything's 
so digitally produced it kind of 

26
00:02:06,351 --> 00:02:10,000
it kind of made sense to add style to 
have that element to my work as well. 

27
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:14,000
I mean, it's hard to pinpoint at what
point you take inspiration from something

28
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:18,000
Cause you're just bombarded by
information constantly, I mean I, I

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,972
spent a lot of time at the internet looking	
at blogs and art websites and 

30
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:27,435
sometimes you don't know where you've
got a little snippet of inspiration from

31
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,455
Cause you don't document everything 
you find cool, do you?

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So yeah I probably looked at some sort of 
computer game or something that 

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,269
influenced that. I kind of like that it has kind of 
a digital quality even though 

34
00:02:38,702 --> 00:02:43,834
it's a hand-drawn thing. There's nothing
computerized about that

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
If you go stand up close to it, it's really a
rough image and the triangles aren't 

36
00:02:48,628 --> 00:02:52,000
you know, proper set lines and everything.

37
00:02:53,476 --> 00:02:58,221
It's obviously hand-drawn up close, but from
a distance, yeah, it looks quite digital.
