00:00:03,365 --> 00:00:06,010
So, I've been in this studio for about a week.

2
00:00:06,805 --> 00:00:10,000
But I'm developing a long-term project with them.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,699
Which involves, effectively in short, 
transplanting an exterior wall in an existing building

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,307
from a site yet to be determined, 
brick by brick, here to the mill.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It just so happened that there's a demolition
happening right now down the street from here.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,153
And I've been observing and documenting the	demolition.

7
00:00:34,153 --> 00:00:36,000
They're doing it all with machines, 
because it's quite a big building.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,751
I've just been asking the guys about, 
you know, demolition and how to do it,

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,460
and it turns out that this company has been
responsible for a lot of the demolition in

10
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,000
Manchester over the last thirty years.	

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,625
And I think this is partially why this project as well.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,329
They seem to have this policy of 
trying to create a new future by razing.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,741
But it's about the spectacle of change, 
and they want people to feel like change is happening,

14
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:05,794
but they don't actually have any real plans
for	what's going to happen to that site yet.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,698
It's mainly about the internet, I guess.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And the way that you sort of have this 
kind of divorced relationship from history.

17
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:22,306
And I was looking at the legacy of the club scene here,
which is a bit of a strange thing,

18
00:01:22,312 --> 00:01:27,000
and sort of what's happening now in terms of kids 
who are a generation younger than I am.

19
00:01:27,724 --> 00:01:30,042
And their relationship to things.	

20
00:01:33,233 --> 00:01:37,101
It kind was about this leveling process with me, 
as someone who's not from here,

21
00:01:37,486 --> 00:01:44,217
and didn't grow up with it, and has a very, 
quite different background but sort of similar interests.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,635
I'm kind of excited for how you can 
access a level playing field, something that happens through

23
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,423
the internet that, you know, like maybe 
me and these kids have an equal access,

24
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,000
which is also kind of one that's also very devoid.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,434
If it's taking that building and 
then trying to just, you know, take it out of time,

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,059
and then make a kind of imprint of it somewhere else,

27
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:17,497
but if it is just of bricks then 
it kind of comes back all apart again.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,253
It's just about carving out a moment, 
kind of like a photograph almost.
