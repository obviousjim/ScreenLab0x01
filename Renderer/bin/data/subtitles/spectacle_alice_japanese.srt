10:0:2,0 --> 0:0:5,0私はヴィジュアルアーティストと、イラストレーターをしているわ 	20:0:5,0 --> 0:0:11,0イラストを描いているの。環境から影響を受けるのと同じ様に30:0:12,0 --> 0:0:15,0私自身のイマジネーションで作られたね。40:0:16,0 --> 0:0:22,0私は作品の主題は私を取り巻いている環境への返答になっているような傾向があると思う50:0:23,0 --> 0:0:26,0私に起こる事に対しての、私自身の個人的な反応というか。 60:0:27,0 --> 0:0:30,0それは単に私が創り出しているイメージの事だけじゃなくて、頻繁に70:0:31,0 --> 0:0:35,0線や、その線でどうイメージを形作るかに関しての実験なの80:0:36,0 --> 0:0:43,0それは拡張されて、ストップモーションの壁画の作品なんかに入り込んでいる90:0:44,0 --> 0:0:48,0その場所に特徴的な環境のストーリーの中で、線の描画についての実験をするという意味では100:0:49,0 --> 0:0:53,0よくそれらでアニメーションを創って、空間に投影し返す110:0:54,0 --> 0:0:56,0そしてインスタレーションの様な物を作るの120:0:57,0 --> 0:1:2,0I guess, I don't know why I draw thatimage like that. I think it was more130:1:3,0 --> 0:1:6,0'cause I draw triangles a lot. And soit was like, it made sense.140:1:7,0 --> 0:1:10,0But it does look like some sort of computer	built graphic model, doesn't it?150:1:12,0 --> 0:1:18,0I look at, a lot of the time when I'mlooking for ideas and research, it's um160:1:19,0 --> 0:1:23,0All the images I'm sort of takinginspiration from are digitally produced 170:1:24,0 --> 0:1:26,0whether that be animation or standard illustration. 180:1:27,0 --> 0:1:32,0Whereas I think I've tried to retainthe hand drawn element to my work190:1:33,0 --> 0:1:36,0because it's about my physical experimentation with the drawing itself. 200:1:37,0 --> 0:1:39,0Um, as opposed to drawing iton the computer. 210:1:40,0 --> 0:1:44,0But then I always seem to lead back to  animating it 220:1:45,0 --> 0:1:50,0and putting it through some sort of digital	process. So it's like adding a stage on.230:1:51,0 --> 0:1:57,0And especially when producing the animations it's like a drawing and then 240:1:58,0 --> 0:2:0,0I feed it back into the computer and then, so obviously250:2:4,0 --> 0:2:6,0In this age where everything's so digitally produced it kind of 260:2:7,0 --> 0:2:10,0 it kind of made sense to add style to 	my work as well. 270:2:11,0 --> 0:2:14,0I mean, it's hard to pinpoint at whatpoint you take inspiration from something280:2:15,0 --> 0:2:18,0Cause you're just bombarded byinformation constantly, I mean I, I290:2:19,0 --> 0:2:22,0spent a lot of time at the internet looking	at blogs and art websites and 300:2:23,0 --> 0:2:27,0sometimes you don't know where you'vegot a little snippet of inspiration from310:2:28,0 --> 0:2:29,0Cause you don't document everything you find cool, do you?320:2:30,0 --> 0:2:34,0So yeah I probably looked at some sort of computer game or something that 330:2:35,0 --> 0:2:38,0influenced that. I kind of like that it has kind of a digital quality even though 340:2:39,0 --> 0:2:24,0it's a hand-drawn thing. There's nothingcomputerized about that350:2:44,0 --> 0:2:48,0If you go stand up close to it, it's really arough image and the triangles aren't 360:2:49,0 --> 0:2:52,0you know, proper set lines and everything.370:2:53,0 --> 0:2:57,0It's obviously hand-drawn up close, but froma distance, yeah, it looks quite digital.
