00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm a print designer, so I design prints 
for fashion, and textiles.

2
00:00:06,579 --> 00:00:08,564
And I'm also a fashion illustrator as well

3
00:00:08,765 --> 00:00:14,000
So mine's kind of, there's a big history 
in textiles so it's kind of old and traditional

4
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:16,000
but I'm doing it all digitally.	

5
00:00:16,227 --> 00:00:22,173
The main things I draw are really feminine. 
So flowers, girls, um stuff like this

6
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,040
So I'll go out and take a lot of photographs 
and then I'll do a lot of hand drawings

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,273
and then getting used to that, 
and then I'll scan them into the computer

8
00:00:30,273 --> 00:00:32,560
and I'll re-draw them on my graphics tablet. 

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And it's the digital versions of flowers and stuff, 
I've colored them all on there as well

10
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:40,384
but they don't look like they've been done on the computer 

11
00:00:40,384 --> 00:00:42,000
they almost look like watercolor.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,654
And even when I draw, 
I'm drawing by hand but onto the screen.ã€‚

13
00:00:47,654 --> 00:00:53,108
So it's still, you know it's still me. 
It's not like me rendering photographs I've taken.

14
00:00:53,108 --> 00:00:56,849
So I've been going back to hand painting 
and hand drawing and scanning them in

15
00:00:56,849 --> 00:01:00,000
and then printing them out and tearing them up, 
and usually it's all just screen

16
00:01:00,618 --> 00:01:02,160
so I'm loving that at the moment. 

17
00:01:02,502 --> 00:01:07,941
I feel like there's not enough time 
to put into hand drawing all the creative processes

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,826
because I work for fashion companies, 
and they want stuff fast. 

19
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,808
and so everything has to be done digitally 

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and I do crave just some time to go back to hand drawing. 	

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,377
I've got loads of collaborations at the moment	
I've got people that want to make jewelry

22
00:01:22,377 --> 00:01:26,627
out of my stuff, I've got a lead singer of a band 
that wants to wear all my stuff 

23
00:01:26,627 --> 00:01:29,564
to the festivals this summer, 
it's all about collaboration, really.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,759
Lots of different companies so lots of
different little projects.
