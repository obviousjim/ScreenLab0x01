1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I can't remember how it exactly happened, 
but I was using animation to generate my visuals

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
to start with. And then I was trying things with
anaglyphic 3-D, and trying to present

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,304
3-D visuals, and I then I was like, well, 
could I control this 3-D environment live,

4
00:00:22,643 --> 00:00:30,309
and display that and more generative visuals? 
So things that are created directly from the music,

5
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:37,616
and the environment that music is in.
SI started out doing visuals in Manchester and

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,875
got more into coding because 
I wanted to bring more interactivity into the visuals,

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,583
so I was playing around with things
like Quartz	Composer and Processing.

8
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:50,030
I knew my library inside-out, my library of clips,
and I wanted something that would be different

9
00:00:50,143 --> 00:00:55,917
each time, but wouldn't mean generating new media each time.
And, just to keep it exciting for myself,

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,839
also I saw the benefits of how some of these 
visuals look, especially when you start introducing

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,821
physics and all these sort of things, 
and the audio-reactive side of it, and I guess through that

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I started realizing there is a digital community out there, 
who are working in creative code

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,845
and using code mainly because code had become far 
more accessible, so it's more documented.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,458
That community's made it more accessible.
Because, I remember trying when I was maybe

15
00:01:28,673 --> 00:01:33,684
thirteen, fourteen, trying to get into code 
and just driving myself crazy and not getting anywhere with it.

16
00:01:34,042 --> 00:01:37,231
So it was, I gave myself about a ten year break and then had another look,

17
00:01:37,602 --> 00:01:39,560
and it starts making more sense.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,792
I think it's going to drive things along must faster,

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,839
I think there's going to be more varied output
the more people you work with.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,679
So, ideas you'd never have come up with 
on your own and problems that need

21
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:59,887
solving - that you can solve - that they made, 
which could drive the creative process.

22
00:02:02,565 --> 00:02:05,197
So I was installing all this stuff on my mom's work machine,

23
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,691
and trying to hack into my mate's computers and open their CD trays,

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,429
and all these sort of things.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,768
I had to go to my mate's house, 
install this little package on his machine,

26
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:18,863
and then I went home and just opened and shut
his CD tray.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And he came in the next day like, 
you won't believe what's going on with my computer.

28
00:02:23,429 --> 00:02:24,589
I was like, I will.

29
00:02:28,237 --> 00:02:32,824
I don't know, sometimes some people think 
they need to know this stuff, when really,

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,242
you might be better off sticking 
with the more traditional side of it.

31
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:44,365
Because it's not an easy thing to start, 
get going on it, especially with code inside of it.

32
00:02:44,574 --> 00:02:49,850
It can put you back a couple of years, 
I think. It's quite intense learning sometimes.

33
00:02:50,942 --> 00:02:56,800
I think the advantage is with working wit
h other people who know different things already,

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
rather than trying to teach yourself - 
which is something I'm guilty of - which is trying

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
to learn everything.

36
00:03:02,825 --> 00:03:10,730
I'm quite keen on building open software 
packages that can be picked up by non-technical people,

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,009
and taken to new areas that would never be expected.
