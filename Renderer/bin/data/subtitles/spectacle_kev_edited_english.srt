1
00:00:02,122 --> 00:00:06,703
We build sound systems, and 
screen printing, and illustration 

2
00:00:06,921 --> 00:00:11,702
but we used to do stuff all by hand
we'd be working to like point 3, 4 of a mil

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and now we're working to like point 1 of a mil 
accuracy because we've got laser cutters

4
00:00:17,363 --> 00:00:21,522
we've got all the cutting jigs 
and it is all cut with hand by routers, but

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,462
you're working from a template 
that you digitally produced

6
00:00:25,955 --> 00:00:29,000
and then once you've got 
that template you've got it forever.

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,557
Dave, you know, he's a proper 
old school carpenter joiner 

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Everything's done by hand, 
and all proper oak and teak and ash

9
00:00:40,638 --> 00:00:44,609
and then we're in here, we're making 
speakers out of birch-ply and MDF

10
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:46,514
and furniture out of birch-ply and stuff like that 

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,840
and we're using like, laser cutters 
and all that, and he's using

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,225
proper old school hand tools and stuff.
And it's just really nice that it's side by side. 

13
00:00:56,634 --> 00:01:00,724
You know you can't, you still need to 
have the hand tooling skills and stuff like that.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You've got to understand the 
intricacies of putting it together

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,434
and how it goes together, 
and what bits you're going to need,

16
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:12,000
and how to mix the hand skills with the CAD/CAM skills

17
00:01:12,298 --> 00:01:18,000
and when I went to school, 
I went to Uni at Salford, eight or nine years ago

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,583
and they didn't have a laser cutter, 
they didn't have anything. 

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
They had a rapid prototyper which 
was the flour and water composite thing,

20
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:32,538
like literally, you touched it and
 it went "PHOOOOSH" like that

21
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:36,874
and it was good, but now here we are 9 years
later and the school I used to teach in

22
00:01:36,874 --> 00:01:41,772
used to have a dimension plotter, 3D Printer, 
like 2 laser cutters

23
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:46,283
a CNC lathe, a CNC router and 
that's in the space of 9 years.

24
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:53,662
And then you've got 11, 12, 13
year old kids who do that type of thing 

25
00:01:53,662 --> 00:01:55,258
right from that age all the way through. 	

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
think the thing that made me realize 
how good and powerful it could all be

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,752
was when I started learning how to use Illustrator. 

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,693
And it just made me go, all right! 
That was like a month ago taking me like a week to do.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,055
It's now taking me four hours. 
It just sort of made me go, huh, all right, yeah

30
00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:20,171
it does make a lot of sense.
