1
00:00:03,012 --> 00:00:08,038
Quite an exciting step for us to know 
that you can do interactive stuff but still 

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,000
have a style to it, and an aesthetic to it, 
that we're more comfortable with as well. 

3
00:00:12,748 --> 00:00:19,181
I think we've hit on the starting point 
of the technology that meets our aesthetics

4
00:00:19,216 --> 00:00:22,000
and then the next step is to push 
the storytelling side of it more

5
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:26,000
I think that it'll be nice to start 
kind of coming back to the characters 

6
00:00:26,417 --> 00:00:33,034
cause really that I think where we, 
what we enjoy is the people side of things

7
00:00:33,176 --> 00:00:37,790
it's why I do more documentary stuff as well, 
and music video based stuff but

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,880
performative, to bring the characters back 
into it now, we've established the look

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and the interactive aspect of it.

10
00:00:45,682 --> 00:00:51,615
One of the nicest, rounded facts 
that we came across was this first

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,717
broadcast that came out of Traffic Park in the 20s, 
so it's literally, probably a stones,

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,744
probably about a hundred miles from where you are now 

13
00:00:59,744 --> 00:01:04,172
in sort of an industrial factories area
was where this original set up was. 

14
00:01:04,337 --> 00:01:07,000
It was just basically a tented structure
that they broadcast from.

15
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:14,566
And they had to devise their own microphone
to be able to play back singing

16
00:01:14,663 --> 00:01:18,275
because the other microphones would just distort
and it was called a "photophone"

17
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,806
they used a series of seven steps that, 
basically they converted sound into light 

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,957
and back into sound again and then back

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,450
A full precursor to anything fiberoptic that's all going on now. 

20
00:01:29,784 --> 00:01:37,563
The history is quite appealing for us, I think.
I tend to fall back into the idea of digging

21
00:01:37,563 --> 00:01:42,000
into some of the kit, in terms of 
sort of a media archeology, and hopefully

22
00:01:42,863 --> 00:01:47,000
start using some of their kit that 
was used in the 40s, 50s, 60s

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,620
and look at what can be done in terms
of twisting that in new ways

24
00:01:51,798 --> 00:01:54,609
some of the cameras, and microphones, and things like that.

25
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,356
So in a cheap way I can shoot on video 
and then reproject back to film to get

26
00:01:59,518 --> 00:02:04,363
the loops and break it down into parts 
and it becomes it's own aesthetic just 

27
00:02:04,363 --> 00:02:09,668
through that process anyway. 
It's got this glow and this sheen that doesn't feel like

28
00:02:09,668 --> 00:02:12,399
it's been shot straight on film, 
it doesn't look like video at all.

29
00:02:12,887 --> 00:02:19,168
We developed quite a lot of our own film stock as well.
We get really nice effects where

30
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,448
we just literally use the container to wind the film through,
then you have to hang it up

31
00:02:23,448 --> 00:02:27,416
in your bathroom to dry and you get all the details
and the blobs on it that gives you the

32
00:02:27,798 --> 00:02:32,269
hand dev in black and white film 
that's synchronized, something like the Kinect

33
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:36,890
you get some lovely results with this. 	Really nice stuff.
